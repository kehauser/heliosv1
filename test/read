this folder houses a variety of test cases used to validate the method.

NievergeltsTLS/
  Yves Nievergelt published a very interesting article entitled "Fitting helices to data by total least squares"
    (Journal: Computer Aided Geometric Design; Year: 1997; Volume: 14; Pages: 707-718)
  In that article, Nievergelt presented a method "similar" to that used in Helios. Table 1 of the article presents the Cartesian 
    coordinates of 10 points of an irregular helix that sweeps 90 degrees (yes, it looks an arc). The radius of the helix the
    points trace is 195 Arbitrary Unites (AU) and the pitch of the helix is 594 AU.
  axis-constraints/
    This directory tests Helios while using constraints on the orientation of the helix axis by bounding the range of Phi and Theta.
  no-constraints/
    This directory tests Helios without any constraints (all five helical parameters are free).
