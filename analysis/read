helang.f90 --- calculate the angle between two vectors based on their spherical coordinates Phi (azimuth) and Theta (longitude)
  compile:
    gfortran helang.f90 -o helang.o
  usage: (phi1 and theta1 are spherical coordinates of the first vector; phi2 and theta2 are spherical coordinates of the second vector)
  input and output values are in degrees
    ./helang2.o [phi1] [theta1] [phi2] [theta2]

helang2.f90 --- interactive version of helang.f90 above
  compile:
    gfortran helang.f90 -o helang2.o
  usage:
    input and output values are in degrees
    ./helang2.o
